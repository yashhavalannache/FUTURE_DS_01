## 📌 Problem Statement
Task 1: E-commerce Sales Analysis — The goal was to analyze sales data from the e-commerce dataset, clean and preprocess the data, create visual dashboards in Power BI, and produce a short business report detailing key metrics and recommendations.

## 🧭 Approach (short)
1. Data cleaning and formatting in Excel (removed duplicates, fixed date formats).
2. Exploratory analysis to find top products, categories and regions.
3. Created interactive dashboards in Power BI (`2_PowerBI/Ecommerce_Dashboard.pbix`).
4. Summarized findings in a written report and presentation (`4_Report/`).

## 🔎 Key Insights (summary)
- Top-performing categories: [CategoryName] (highest sales & profit).  
- Sales trend: Month-over-month increase in Q2 — recommend promotional focus in months X and Y.  
- Top products: Product A, Product B — account for ~Z% of revenue.  
- Regional insight: Region R shows high revenue but low profit margin — investigate discounting/costs.

> **Note:** Replace bracketed items like `[CategoryName]`, `Product A` and metrics with your actual numbers/observations.
